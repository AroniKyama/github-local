<p>AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.</p>
<p>
AJAX is a technique for creating fast and dynamic web pages. AJAX is about updating parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.</p>
<p>
AJAX is based on internet standards, and uses a combination of:

<li>XMLHttpRequest object (to retrieve data from a web server)
<li>JavaScript/DOM (to display/use the data)</p>
<p>
XMLHttpRequest is a misleading name. You don't have to understand XML to use AJAX.
